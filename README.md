# Tech Blog

## Description

The application follows the MVC (model, view, controller) paradigm for its full stack structure. The Model, View and Controller are created using Sequelize/MySQL, Handlebars.js and Express respectively.

## Accessing Application
The app. is deployed live through heroku at https://rocky-dusk-02612.herokuapp.com/

## File Installation
While installing files is not necessary to use the application, to modify or observe file one can clone the repository and use the command 
  - npm install
to install all necessary dependencies. Afterwards one must create a .env file for server inputs and use the mysql command 'source db/schema.sql' to create the database.
